# pong_clone
This is my pong_clone made as the first game in the 20 game challange. 
https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/how/
I made this game based purely on reading the documentation. I did check briefly correct menu procedure elswhere and have used GPT where I need explanations but tried to avoid copying suggested code.

Includes one very complicated Tennis score function, probably the most interesting part.
