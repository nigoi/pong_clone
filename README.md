# pong_clone
â€‹This is my pong_clone made as the first game in the 20-game challenge. https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/how/ I made this game based purely on reading the documentation. I briefly checked the correct menu procedure elsewhere and used GPT where I needed explanations but tried to avoid copying the suggested code.

It includes one very complicated tennis score function, which is probably the most interesting part.
